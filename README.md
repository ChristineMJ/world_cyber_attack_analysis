PHASE 1 : ASK
Key objectives: Why do we analyize cyber attacks all over the world? There can be many important reasons:

Awareness: Analyzing cyber attacks can help raise awareness about the current state of cybersecurity and the threat landscape. This can help individuals, businesses, and organizations understand the risks and take proactive steps to protect themselves.
Mitigation: By analyzing past cyber attacks, we can identify common vulnerabilities and attack patterns. This information can be used to develop and implement effective security measures to mitigate the risk of future attacks.
Response: Cyber attacks can have serious consequences, ranging from financial losses to damage to critical infrastructure. Analyzing past attacks can help inform incident response strategies and help organizations respond more effectively to future attacks.
Law Enforcement: Analyzing cyber attacks can also help law enforcement agencies identify and track down cyber criminals, leading to their prosecution and prevention of future attacks.
Global Cooperation: Cyber attacks are a global issue, and analyzing attacks worldwide can help facilitate global cooperation and information sharing among governments, businesses, and organizations to better protect against cyber threats.
Purpose of this Anaylsis:

Analyzing cyber attacks worldwide is crucial for improving cybersecurity awareness, developing effective security measures, improving incident response, prosecuting cyber criminals, and promoting global cooperation to protect against cyber threats.
